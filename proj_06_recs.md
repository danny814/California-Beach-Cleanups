# California Beach Cleanups

## Analysis-Based Recommendations

### 1. Temporal Trends

__1.0 Plan awareness campaigns and cleanup efforts around seasons/months with historically higher levels of beach litter.__<br />

As we can see from the charts above, there is a seasonal aspect to the amounts of trash reported to have been collected that mirrors the same trend as the peak cleanup season.

Awareness campaigns and promotional content should be targeted towards the beginning of late summer (late June and early August) as the majority of groups begin to launch more cleanups. Recruiting more participants before established groups begin to cleanup after each year's summer visitors would mean more trash collected, more efficient resource allocation, and possibly more long-term participants with the increase in community outreach.

__1.1 Allocate resources to strategically address peak periods__

Established groups that receive government funding and donations should hone their efforts towards seasons where the most trash is observed. In doing so, resources are allocated efficiently and more cleanups can be performed with the same funding. Such groups should also consider allocating resources to "standby groups" that conduct cleanups during non-peak seasons to maintain overall beach cleanliness.

### 2. Geographical Patterns

__2.0 Prioritize cleanup efforts in "high-priority" regions where consistently high levels of trash are observed.__

Established groups in the San Francisco, San Luis Obispo, Los Angeles, and San Diego counties should seek support from smaller groups and volunteers in nearby counties (where trash is not as prominent) to aid in their cleanup efforts, as these counties in particular displayed the highest volume of reported trash over the timeframe.

These counties should also allocate resources towards educating short and long-term visitors about cleaning up after themselves as well as others. Data visualizations within adverts stressing ecological impact and community obligation should be utilized.

__2.1 Collaborate with local communities and organizations in specific areas to promote cleanup initiatives and campaigns.__

Groups belonging to high-priority counties should seek funding/resources/support from local communities and organizations to increase the number of cleanups and the volume of cleanup participants. This support could be government-based (rehabilitation/community service programs and grants), institution-based (college/church/etc. based clubs and initiatives), or business-based (n number of community service days off, business-sponsored cleanup campaigns, etc.).

### 3. Trash Composition

__3.0 Tailor educational campaigns and outreach efforts to address the highest priority litter types.__

![comp_totals_by_year](comp_totals_by_y.png)

From the chart above, we can see that cigarette butts, food wrappers, and plastic/foam pieces are the trash types with the highest composition percentages based on reported trash.

Adverts and educational materials should be tailored to address these three trash types in particular. Further analyses should be performed to assess the relationship of the number/proximity of trashcans and the overall cleanliness of beaches.

__3.1 Advocate for the reduced use of high contributors to trash composition. Work with relevant industries and local companies for sustainable alternatives.__

Plastic derivatives continuously lead the way in trash type reported. If possible, established groups should work with local businesses to seek more biodegradable alternatives. Businesses that take these initiatives could pave the way for others, and in doing so, would increase community outreach and support for such businesses.

### 4. Impact Assessment

__4.0 Follow up analysis with thorough impact assessments in select regions to understand the factors influencing successful cleanup outcomes.__

Regular monitoring of the impact of campaigns will allow for us to refine our strategy and guide future projects. The most successful/impactful campaigns will serve as the basis for local and larger projects alike.
